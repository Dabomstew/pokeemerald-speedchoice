MoveTutorText[]=[12,7,0,5,0x30,Fine! [move] it is! Which POKéMON wants to learn it?]
MoveTutorText[]=[12,7,0,5,0x60,For a long time, I’ve taught POKéMON how to use [move], but I’ve yet to ignite my own explosion…\pMaybe it’s because deep down, I would rather stay here…]
MoveTutorText[]=[29,6,4,4,0x0D,There’s a move that is wickedly cool.\pIt’s called [move].\nWant me to teach it to a POKéMON?]
MoveTutorText[]=[8,5,0,5,0x0D,I want all sorts of things! But I used up my allowance…\pWouldn’t it be nice if there were a spell that made money appear when you waggle a finger?\pIf you want, I can teach your POKéMON the move [move].\pMoney won’t appear, but your POKéMON will do well in battle. Yes?]
MoveTutorText[]=[8,5,0,5,0x60,When a POKéMON uses [move], all sorts of nice things happen.]
MoveTutorText[]=[7,4,3,3,0x0D,Ah, young one!\pI am also a young one, but I mimic the styles and speech of the elderly folks of this town.\pWhat do you say, young one? Would you agree to it if I were to offer to teach the move [move]?]
MoveTutorText[]=[7,4,3,3,0x60,[move] is a move of great depth.\pCould you execute it to perfection as well as me…?]
MoveTutorText[]=[7,4,3,3,0x56,Oh, boo! I wanted to teach [move] to your POKéMON!]
MoveTutorText[]=[16,0,2,10,0x0D,Did you know that you can go from here a long way in that direction without changing direction?\pI might even be able to roll that way.\pDo you think your POKéMON will want to roll, too?\pI can teach one the move [move] if you’d like.]
MoveTutorText[]=[24,12,5,2,0x0D,Humph! My wife relies on HIDDEN POWER to stay awake.\pShe should just take a nap like I do.\pI can teach your POKéMON how to [move]. Interested?]
MoveTutorText[]=[24,12,5,2,0x60,I’ve never once gotten my wife’s coin trick right.\pI would be happy if I got it right even as I teach [move]…]
MoveTutorText[]=[14,13,21,4,0x0D,When I see the wide world from up here on the roof…\pI think about how nice it would be if there were more than just one me so I could enjoy all sorts of lives.\pOf course it’s not possible. Giggle…\pI know! Would you be interested in having a POKéMON learn [move]?]
MoveTutorText[]=[14,13,21,4,0x30,Giggle… Which POKéMON do you want me to teach [move]?]
MoveTutorText[]=[14,13,21,4,0x56,Oh, no?\pA POKéMON can do well in a battle using it, you know.]
MoveTutorText[]=[25,9,6,9,0x0D,Heh! My POKéMON totally rules! It’s cooler than any POKéMON!\pI was lipping off with a swagger in my step like that when the CHAIRMAN chewed me out.\pThat took the swagger out of my step.\pIf you’d like, I’ll teach the move [move] to a POKéMON of yours.]
MoveTutorText[]=[25,9,6,9,0x30,All right, which POKéMON wants to learn how to [move]?]
MoveTutorText[]=[25,9,6,9,0x60,I’ll just praise my POKéMON from now on without the [move].]
